# 003_Namings

## Variable Naming Requirements

- Start with a letter or the underscore character
- Cannot start with a number
- Can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- Cannot be any of the Python keywords.

## Importance of efficient naming

- Explaination of codes
- Increase readability

##### Legal Variable Naming
###### For example
```python
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
```

##### Illegal Variable Naming
###### For example
```python
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
```

## Multi Words Variable Names

##### Camel Case
###### Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
###### *Camel Case got its name because the hunching back of the words looks like the back of a camel.
```python
myVariableName = "John"
```

##### Pascal Case
###### Each word starts with a capital letter:
```python
MyVariableName = "John"
```

##### Snake Case
###### Each word is separated by an underscore character:
###### *Snake Case got its name because the underscores of the words made it look look like a snake (most commonly used in python)
```python
myVariableName = "John"
```
