# 01_Comments

## Uses of python comments

- Explaination of codes
- Increase readability
- Prevent being executed when testing

## Creating a comment

#### There are two ways of creating comments in python 
- single line comments
- multiline comments

##### Single line comments begin with ```#```

###### For example
  
```python
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

```python
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```
###### Comments need not be explainations to the current code, it can be used to prevent the compiler form executing the code
```python
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```
##### Multiline comments begin and ends with ```"""``` and ```#``` still can be used!

```python
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
```

```python
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
